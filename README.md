This repo contains a Cyprus culture test based on data from [Herodotus Bot](https://github.com/vladIev/herodotus-bot).

## About the test
The test has two modes: ***Learning*** and ***Self-test***.

***Learning*** mode suggests choosing from several answers and counting passed and failed questions.

The ***Self-test*** mode could be activated in the bottom right corner and allow you to check yourself.

Also check the same corner to switch language on a fly between Greek and Russian.

**[⚠️Try the test here. 🍀Good luck!](https://mrfeod.github.io/cycult/)**
